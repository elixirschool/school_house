## Enum

The `Enum` module includes over 70 functions for working with enumerables.
All the collections that we learned about in the [previous lesson](../collections/), with the exception of tuples, are enumerables.

This lesson will only cover a subset of the available functions, however we can actually examine them ourselves.
Let's do a little experiment in IEx.
