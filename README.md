# School House

School House is the new era of [elixirschool.com](https://elixirschool.com) now powered by Elixir and Phoenix :tada:

By leveraging Dashbit's [NimblePublisher](https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_publisher) and some restructing of the existing lessons we're able to use the lessons so many have contributed to while delivering them in an improved experience!

## Development

At this time there's a little more work to setup for local development.
To start we need to checkout a branch from `elixirschool/elixirschool` that's already had some processing done to the lessons to work with NimblePublisher.
After that is complete we need to create a symbolic link (for now) to that project and rename it to `lessons`:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:elixirschool/school_house.git
$ cd school_house
$ git clone git@github.com:elixirschool/elixirschool.git content
$ cd content
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout lessons-only
```

From here the rest is as you would expect with Phoenix! :tada:
